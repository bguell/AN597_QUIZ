import hte zombies file
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)

```
okay so its now a dataframe called d

now i need to wrangle some data!
lets use dpylr!
```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(d)
df=tbl_df(d)
df
#only get first and last names of females survivors using piping

surf <- df %>% #name it somethign new
  select(first_name, last_name, gender) %>% #select only the colums of names and gender
  filter(gender=="Female") %>% #select rows only where gender==female
  select(first_name, last_name) #then only get teh columns of names... propbably could have done filter FIRST and then this.. but this works i think...
surf

```
extra credit attempt....
```{r}
wave <- df %>%
  group_by(weight, height) %>%
  mutate(mean_weight=(mean(weight), mean_height=mean(height)))
         wave
```






#Quiz #2
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)

```
ets use dpylr!
```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(d)
df=tbl_df(d)
df
#only get first and last names of females survivors using piping

surf <- df %>% #name it somethign new
  select(first_name, last_name, height, weight, zombies_killed, gender) %>% #select only the colums of names and gender
  filter(gender=="Female") %>% #select rows only where gender==female
  select(first_name, last_name, height, weight, zombies_killed) #then only get teh columns of names... propbably could have done filter FIRST and then this.. but this works i think...

surf
```


okay so now graph difference betwee zombies killed by height, between geight categories

```{r}

surf=mutate(surf, categories=c(surf$height>=65,surf$height<65))
surf


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(surf, aes(x=height, y=zombies_killed)) +geom_boxplot(aes(group=c(surf$height[surf$height>=65], surf$height[surf$height<65])))
```
