import hte zombies file
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)

```
okay so its now a dataframe called d

now i need to wrangle some data!
lets use dpylr!
```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(d)
df=tbl_df(d)
df
#only get first and last names of females survivors using piping

surf <- df %>% #name it somethign new
  select(first_name, last_name, gender) %>% #select only the colums of names and gender
  filter(gender=="Female") %>% #select rows only where gender==female
  select(first_name, last_name) #then only get teh columns of names... propbably could have done filter FIRST and then this.. but this works i think...
surf

```

```{r}
wave <- df %>%
  group_by(weight, height) %>%
  mutate(summarise(mean(weight))
```
